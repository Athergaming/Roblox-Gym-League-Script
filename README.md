Roblox Gym League Script, it has basically every feature, currently only supports the first 3 gyms (Need to add other gyms), has auto roll aura, auto 100%, tp to machine, etc.

```

> optionally, you can copy and paste the entire raw file, but this is easier, idc what you do with it.
# Errors:
The script has been tested by me a lot, but I am a one man team so I can always miss some bugs, feel free to dm me with the contact below.
Current bugs being fixed:

``1. After 100% train turned on, auto train doesn't train the selected equipment(current fix, reselect the equioment). Progress: Fixed next update``
